    <p>A16. Former Canadian Armed Forces members / Veterans who served and released at a time when only the SIN was being used as a Canadian Armed Forces service number should provide their social insurance number as a reference in place of a service number when sending in a request for a Veteran’s Service Card. Be assured that the social insurance number will only be used to verify the Veteran's military service record, and it will not appear on the Veteran’s Service Card. If you received a nine character service number following your release from the Canadian Armed Forces, you should use this number on the application when you request the Veteran’s Service Card.</p>

The first time was for eight years in the Reserve Force in the 1990s, reaching the rank of Sergeant, and then in the Regular Force, from 2003 to 2007. I was given credit for prior military service when I re-enlisted in 2003, but because I also changed trades I was reduced by two ranks to Corporal. I released for the second time in 2007 as a Master Corporal. Will my Veteran’s Service Card reflect my Sergeant rank?</summary>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>A18. For administrative consistency, and to maintain the integrity of the Veteran’s Service Card for all veterans, it will show the rank the member held upon final release from the Canadian Armed Forces. There are a number of reasons that a Canadian Armed Forces member’s rank on final release could be lower than at some other time during their period of service. This could include because the member:</p>
<ul>
<li>temporarily held an acting higher rank;</li>
<li>was demoted a rank or more because of a court martial or administrative action; or</li>
<li>accepted a reduced rank to re-train when changing environments, components, or military occupations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rank on final release is a standard that can be applied equally to all Veteran’s Service Card recipients.</p>

        <summary>Q19. I retired from Canada’s military honourably in 1986.  The Veteran’s Service Card e-application portal allows for uploading a certificate of service that shows a Veteran served in the Canadian Armed Forces.  I understand that it’s optional, but I’ve been told that my Veteran’Service Card request might be processed faster if I attach a certificate of service with my application. What would such a document look like?</summary>
        <div class="mwsgeneric-base-html parbase section">



    A19. A document that shows that a person served in the Canadian Armed Forces may
 be called different names (certificate of service, record of service, discharge certificate, release certificate, etc.) and may be dependent on a number of factors, including the period of time when a Veteran served. It could be specific to the Canadian Armed Forces environment (Navy, Army, Air Force, Special Operations Force), component (Regular or Reserve Force), regiment (PPCLI, R22e, Royal Newfoundland Regiment, etc.), branch (engineering, logistics, medical, etc.) or military occupation.  Attaching a copy of any former military service document issued by the Canadian Armed Forces that can be authenticated by the Veteran’s Service Card verification team and cross-matched against a Veteran’s  former military service file will help in speeding up the application process.

        <div class="mwsgeneric-base-html parbase section">



    <p>A20: If your Veteran’s Service Card online application was submitted successfully you should receive the following acknowledgement:&nbsp;<strong>“Your Veteran's Service Card Application form has been submitted successfully and is being processed. Should any additional information be required we will contact you.”</strong></p>
<p>If you receive an error message while you are uploading documents as attachments or while you are submitting your application, it may be for one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Veteran's Service Card e-application portal is configured to ensure Veterans' privacy and security. The anti-malware protection software supporting the portal may reject VSC applications from computers with less secure profiles. It may also reject applications with attachments of documents potentially affected with viruses, or other detected security issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing Out</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a time limit within the online form to ensure the security of your data, if the form is not submitted within a certain time limit you will get an error message and will need to restart the application process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attachment File Size and Type</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The portal will only allow the upload of a maximum file size of 10MB in the following document formats: .jpg, .png and .pdf. Attachments of other file formats, or a total file size of more than 10MB will not be accepted by the system and may result in an error message.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser Issues</strong><br>The portal has been tested to work on multiple web browsers, however some browser may work better than others to complete a submission due to their technology and security. The testing of the Veteran's Service Card e-application portal in all browser configurations is ongoing by the technical team to ensure that it can accommodate most technologies.</li>
