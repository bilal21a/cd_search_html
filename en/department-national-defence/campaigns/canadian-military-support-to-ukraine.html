        <h2>Military Donations</h2>
<p>Since February 2022, Canada has committed over $2.4 billion in military assistance donations to Ukraine.</p>
<p>We continue to actively look at what more we can do to support Ukraine. <span class="nowrap">Minister Blair</span>&nbsp;remains in close contact with Ukrainian officials through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, and on a bilateral basis.</p>
<p>We deeply admire the bravery and courage of Ukrainians who are fighting to defend their independence and freedom, and we will continue to work closely with our Allies and partners to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and security.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Operational Support</h2>
<p>Canada and Ukraine are close partners with a long-standing defence relationship. Operation (Op) UNIFIER, the Canadian Armed <span class="nowrap">Forces (CAF)</span> military training and capacity building mission in Ukraine, was launched in 2015 at the request of the Ukrainian government, and in 2023, was expanded and extended until <span class="nowrap">March&nbsp;2026</span>.</p>
<p>Since the start of Op UNIFIER, the CAF has trained over 39,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel in battlefield tactics and advanced military skills. As the mission progressed, much of the direct training undertaken by CAF members transitioned to members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with Canadians acting as advisors and mentors as well as assisting in the development of courses.</p>
<p>Over <span class="nowrap">300&nbsp;CAF members</span> are now deployed under Op&nbsp;UNIFER in various roles such as the provision and coordination of training, national command support, and the facilitation and delivery of military donations to Ukraine in coordination with Allies and Partners.</p>
<p>Canada's military contributions, including training, equipment, and transport, have been integral in Ukraine's counter offensive to-date, and we will continue to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to defend its sovereignty, freedom, and independence.</p>
<p>Since the invasion in February&nbsp;2022, this has included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The training of over 5,000 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in third locations with the recommencement of large scale individual training, on both basic and specialized skills in concert with our Allies.</li>
<li>The deployment of aircraft to assist with the delivery of Ukraine bound military aid not only from Canada, but from Allied and partner nations. Since <span class="nowrap">March&nbsp;2022</span>, the amount of aid delivered by Air Mobility Detachment - Prestwick, has totaled over <span class="nowrap">fourteen&nbsp;million</span> pounds.</li>
<li>From April to July&nbsp;2022, the CAF provided assistance to Ukrainian refugees in reception centres located in Warsaw, operated by the Polish Territorial Defence Force. During this time, CAF members helped thousands of refugees with administrative support, limited medical care, mental health supports, and spiritual services.</li>
