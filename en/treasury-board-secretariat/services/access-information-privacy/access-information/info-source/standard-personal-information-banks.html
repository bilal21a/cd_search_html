    <p>Personal information banks (PIBs) are descriptions of personal information under the control of a government institution that is organized and retrievable by an individual's name or by a number, symbol or other element that identifies that individual. The personal information described in a PIB has been used, is being used or is available for an administrative purpose. The PIB describes how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, retained and/or disposed of in the administration of a government institution's program or activity. </p> 
<p>There are three types of PIBs: central, institution-specific and standard. The following descriptions are standard PIBs. They describes information about members of the public as well as current and former federal employees contained in records created, collected and maintained by most government institutions in support of common internal services. These include personal information relating to human resources management, travel, corporate communications and other administrative services. Standard PIBs are created by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. </p> 
<p>Individuals seeking access to the institution-specific Personal Information Banks of a particular government institution should consult the <a href="list-institutions.html">institution’s Info Source chapter</a>.</p>
